## Overview

Business Finder is a tool that combines a visual map interface with the power of the Google Places API to help you find and export business data. Whether you're conducting market research, planning business outreach, or analyzing competition, this tool makes it easy to:

1. Visually select a geographic area on a map
2. Set a precise search radius
3. Search for specific business types
4. Filter results based on ratings, review counts, and contact information
5. Export complete business details to CSV or JSON

## Features

- **Interactive Map Interface**: Select any location worldwide with a simple click
- **Visual Radius Selection**: Adjust your search radius by dragging or using a slider
- **Flexible Search Terms**: Find any type of business (restaurants, hotels, retail, etc.)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter results by rating, review count, and contact information availability
- **Sortable Results**: Sort business listings by name, address, rating, or review count
- **Comprehensive Data Export**: Get business names, addresses, phone numbers, websites, ratings, and more
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Save results as CSV or JSON
- **Command-Line Interface**: Run searches programmatically or from scripts
- **Web Server Mode**: Run as a local server for a complete web application experience

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Google Maps API key (with Places API enabled)

### Install from Source

```bash

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery:

- **Python CI**: A combined workflow that runs:
  - **Linting**: Checks code quality with flake8, black, and isort
  - **Tests**: Runs the test suite on multiple Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- **Python Publish**: Builds and publishes the package to PyPI when a new release is created

These CI workflows ensure that:
- All tests pass on every push and pull request
- Code follows consistent style guidelines
- Test coverage remains high
- Package releases are tested before publishing

For detailed instructions on running CI checks locally before pushing, see [CI_GUIDE.md](CI_GUIDE.md).

## Quick Start

### 1. Using the Makefile (Recommended)

The project includes a Makefile with simple commands to get you started quickly:

```bash
# View all available commands
make help

# Set up the Poetry environment
make setup

# Configure your Google API key
make configure

# Run the web server
make run-server
```

### 2. Manual Setup

#### Configure Your API Key

```bash
# Set your Google API key 
business-finder config --set-api-key "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
```

#### Use the Web Interface

You can use Business Finder in two ways:

##### Option A: Standalone HTML page
Open `web/index.html` in your browser (add your API key to the URL):
```
file:///path/to/business-finder/web/index.html?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

##### Option B: Run the built-in web server
```bash
# Start the web server
python web/server.py

# Open in your browser
# http://localhost:8000
```

The web server automatically injects your API key from your configuration, so you don't need to manually add it to the HTML file.

### 3. Using the Web Interface

Follow these steps:
1. Click anywhere on the map to set your search center
2. Adjust the circle radius by dragging or using the slider
3. Enter your search term (e.g., "coffee shop")
4. Click "Search Businesses" to see results
5. Filter and sort results as needed
6. Download results as CSV or click "Copy Parameters" to get the command-line version

### 4. Run the Search

```bash
# Using parameters copied from the web interface
business-finder search --json-params '{"search_term":"coffee shop","latitude":37.7749,"longitude":-122.4194,"radius":1000}'

# Or save parameters to a file and use that
business-finder search --params-file location.json
```

### 4. View Results

Results will be saved to the `data/` directory by default. You can specify a different output file:

```bash
business-finder search --json-params '...' --output data/my_results.csv
```

When using the web interface, results are displayed directly in the browser and can be:
- Filtered by minimum rating, minimum review count, or contact information
- Sorted by clicking on any column header
- Downloaded as CSV for the complete set or just the filtered view

# Search for hotels in a large 10km radius around London
# Breaking it into smaller 2km sub-searches with 10 parallel workers
business-finder search --search-term "hotel" --latitude 51.5074 --longitude -0.1278 --radius 10000 --sub-radius 2000 --max-workers 10 --output london_hotels.csv
```

## Integration Options

### Programmatic Usage

You can use the package directly in your Python code:

```python
from business_finder.api.places import search_places
from business_finder.exporters.csv_exporter import write_to_csv

# Basic search (single API call)
businesses = search_places(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    search_term="gym",
    latitude=34.0522,
    longitude=-118.2437,
    radius=1500
)

# Grid-based search for larger radius (multiple API calls in parallel)
businesses_large_area = search_places(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    search_term="gym",
    latitude=34.0522,
    longitude=-118.2437,
    radius=10000,        # Large radius that will be split into smaller searches
    sub_radius=2500,     # Each sub-search will use this radius
    max_workers=8        # Number of parallel searches
)

# Export results
write_to_csv(businesses_large_area, "los_angeles_gyms.csv")
```

### Web Service Integration

For a complete web service, check out the [business-finder-service](https://github.com/yourusername/business-finder-service) repository, which adds:

- REST API endpoints
- Direct file downloads
- User authentication
- Search history

## Grid-Based Search for Large Areas

Business Finder includes an advanced grid-based search feature that overcomes the Google Places API's limitation of 60 results per search:

### How It Works

1. When a large radius is specified, the area is automatically divided into a grid of smaller sub-areas
2. Each sub-area is searched independently (in parallel)
3. The results are combined and deduplicated
4. The final set is returned to the user

This approach allows you to search much larger areas and get more comprehensive results than would be possible with a single API call.

### Configuration

You can configure the grid search parameters using either the CLI or YAML configuration files:

#### CLI Configuration

```bash
# Set the sub-radius (in meters) for grid searches
business-finder config --set-sub-radius 3000

# Set the maximum number of concurrent searches
business-finder config --set-max-workers 8

# View current configuration
business-finder config --show

# Export configuration to a YAML file
business-finder config --export-config ~/my-business-finder-config.yaml
```

#### YAML Configuration

Business Finder also supports YAML configuration files for more flexibility. Create or edit a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
# API Configuration
api:
  key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# Search Configuration
search:
  # Sub-radius in meters for grid-based searches
  sub_radius: 3000
  
  # Maximum number of concurrent searches
  max_workers: 5
```

Configuration files are searched in the following order of precedence:
1. `~/.business_finder/config.yaml` (global user configuration)
2. `./config.yaml` (project directory configuration)
3. `~/.business_finder/config.json` (legacy configuration)

A sample configuration file is provided at `config.yaml.example` in the project root.

You can also specify these parameters for individual searches:

```bash
# Override default sub-radius and max workers for this search
business-finder search --search-term "restaurant" --latitude 40.7128 --longitude -74.0060 --radius 10000 --sub-radius 2500 --max-workers 10
```

### Performance Considerations

- Using smaller sub-radii will result in more comprehensive results but will make more API calls
- Increasing max-workers speeds up searches but uses more concurrent connections
- API usage costs and rate limits should be considered when adjusting these parameters

### Search Logs and Debugging

Business Finder provides a detailed logging system for grid-based searches, allowing you to see exactly what's happening in the background:

- **Grid Generation**: See how the search area is divided into smaller sub-areas
- **Search Progress**: Track the progress of each sub-search in real-time
- **Result Deduplication**: View statistics on duplicate results that are filtered out
- **Performance Metrics**: Get timing information for each search operation

To access search logs:

1. **In the Web UI**:
   - Click "Toggle Debug Mode" to enable debugging features
   - After performing a search, the logs will be automatically displayed
   - Or click "Show Search Logs" to view logs from the most recent search
   - Filter logs by level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG)

2. **In the CLI**:
   - Search logs are printed to the standard output during searches
   - Use the `--verbose` flag for additional debug information:
     ```bash
     business-finder search --search-term "restaurant" --latitude 51.5074 --longitude -0.1278 --radius 10000 --verbose
     ```

## Limitations

- Even with grid-based search, the Google Places API has rate limits that may affect very large searches
- API usage is subject to Google's pricing and quota limits
- Very dense areas may still not return all possible results

## Debugging Tools

Business Finder includes several debugging tools to help diagnose and fix issues:

### Debug Mode

To access debugging tools:
1. Click the "🐞 Debug" button in the toolbar
2. Debug mode will be enabled, revealing additional tools and information

In debug mode, you can:
- View detailed API responses
- See internal system logs
- Access database maintenance tools

### Database Migrations

If you encounter database errors after updating to a new version, you can fix them using:

1. Enable Debug Mode by clicking the "🐞 Debug" button
2. Click the "🔧 Fix DB" button that appears in the toolbar
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to update your database schema
4. Refresh the page after the fix is complete

This will automatically update your database schema to be compatible with the current version of Business Finder.
